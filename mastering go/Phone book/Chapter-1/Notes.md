# Chapter 1:

Go is an open source programming language which initially developed as an internal Google project that went public back in 2009. The spritual fathers of Go are Robert Griesemer, Ken Thomson, and Rob Pike.

**Robert Griesemer**:<br>
Robert Griesemer (born 1964) is a Swiss computer scientist. He is best known for his work on the Go programming language. Prior to Go, he worked on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, the Sawzall language (programming language for logging made by Google), the Java HotSpot virtual machine, and the Strongtalk system.[Visit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer)

**Ken Thompson**:<br>
Kenneth Lane Thompson (born February 4, 1943) is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson worked at Bell Labs for most of his career where he designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language, the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of the Plan 9 operating system. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-developed the Go programming language.

Other notable contributions included his work on regular expressions and early computer text editors QED and ed, the definition of the UTF-8 encoding, and his work on computer chess that included the creation of endgame tablebases and the chess machine Belle. He won the Turing Award in 1983 with his long-term colleague Dennis Ritchie.[Visit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson)

**Rob Pike**:<br>
Robert Pike (born 1956) is a Canadian programmer and author. He is best known for his work on the Go programming language while working at Google and the Plan 9 operating system while working at Bell Labs, where he was a member of the Unix team.

Pike wrote the first window system for Unix in 1981. He is the sole inventor named in the US patent for overlapping windows on a computer display.

With Brian Kernighan, he is the co-author of The Practice of Programming and The Unix Programming Environment. With Ken Thompson, he is the co-creator of UTF-8.[Visit Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike)

Although the official name of the language is Go, it is sometimes wrongly referred to as Golang.The official reason for this is that og.org was not available for registrationand golang.org was chosen instead. And the practical reason for this is that when you are querying a search engine for Go, the word Go is usually interpreted as a verb.
