# Chapter 11: Code Testing and Profiling

Code optimization is the process where one or more developers try to make certain parts of a program run faster, be more efficient, or use fewer resources. 
Put simplly, code optimization is about eliminating the bottlenecks of a program that matter.

Code testing is about making sure that your code does what you want it to do.
The best time to write testing code is during development, as this can help to reveal bugs in the code as early as possible. 
Code profiling relates to measuring certain aspects of a program to get a detailed understanding of the way the code works. The results of code profiling may help you to decide which parts of your code need to change.

Have in mind that when writing code, we should focus on its correctness as well as other desirable properties such as readability, simplicity, and maintainability, not its performance. Once we are sure that the code is correct, then we might need to focus on its performance. A good trick on performance is to execute the code on machines that are going to be a bit slower than the ones that are going to be used in production.
